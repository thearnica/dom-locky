ðŸ™ˆLoki  - is God of Mischief, Madness and Evil!

ðŸ™‰Locky - is God of Locks, Event capturing and Stealing. Small and very slender brother - just 1kb.

ðŸ™ŠLocky will never let event escape the target node, will prevent scrolls outside, will do the HTML5 `inert` job.

Locky will completely disable any user iterations outside of nested children.

And it has a twin-brother - [react-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-locky)
```js
import {lockyOn} from 'dom-locky';

const unlock = lockyOn('.modal', extraProps);
const unlock = lockyOn(myElement, { onEscape: callback });
//......
unlock();
```

# Unpkg
 You may also include this library from unpkg as [https://unpkg.com/dom-locky](https://unpkg.com/dom-locky).
 Then locky will be available as `locky` global variable.

# API
 Locky accepts selector or HTMLElement as a first argument, and locky will be activated only on the first element matching selector
 Locky accepts a settings as a second argument
 - onEscape, will be triggered when someone will try "escape" the lock. See "report" events below
 - noDefault[=false], disables all "default" events
 - events[=defaultEvents], DOM events to manage
 - group[=null], focus group id. Locks with the same group will not block each other.
 
# Default events
 - click: 'report' (will call `onEscape`)
 - mousemove: true,
 - mousedown: 'report' (will call `onEscape`)
 - touchmove: true,
 - touchstart: 'report' (will call `onEscape`)
 - keydown: true,
 - focus: false, (focus is unblockable)
 - change: false,
 - scroll: true, (scroll is handled separately)
 - wheel: true, 
 
# Focus
 Locky could not propely handle __focus__ events, and will let it get out of the form, and will block attemps to return it, as long they will have source out of the lock.
 To scope a focus use [dom-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/dom-focus-lock)
 
# Tip
__important__ tip for __Mobile Safary__ - while normal "touch move" will
scroll "scrollable" container, touch+move started on inputs will start
__drag-n-drop__ and cause whole layer(modal/page) scroll. 
(it will just scroll as a ðŸ’©, or not scroll at all).

To disable this behavior - apply ` -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` on the page.
